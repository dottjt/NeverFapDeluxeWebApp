      <p>You distrusted the process and you lost.</p> <!-- emoji -->
      <p>As I've said on many occasions, it takes 5 years on average for people to overcome their porn addiction and certainly, no one is ever exception to the rule.</p>
      <p>Given that this was to be expected, my job at this point is to educate you on why it happened, as well as get you back on track with your porn addiction recovery journey.</p>

      <p>And the more you read it, and engrain this knowledge into your head, the more you'll grow and develop as a person.</p>
      <p>No only is it one less moment spent reinforcing your addiction, however you're even deciding to go a step-further by using this opportunity to educate yourself.</p>
      <p>Now, the reason why this is significant is because since your relapse...</p>

      <h3>Healthy Coping Mechanisms > Emotions</h3>
      <p>A lot of people assume that you must be feeling happy all the time in order to overcome porn addiction.</p>
      <p>It's simply not true, and in fact is the polar inverse to what we are trying to learn.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, we're learning to become comfortable with our difficult emotions, as opposed to avoid them.</p>
      <p>The emotions aren't the issue. The issue is your ability to respond to them.</p>

      <p>In order to get you back on track, there's a few things we must do.</p>

      <h2>Your emotions.</h2>
      <p>At this point, you've lost control.</p>
      <p>And I bet you're feeling pretty stupid for having thrown it all away.</p>
      <p>You're probably feeling a lot of emotion right now.</p>

    <p>Well, guess what?</p>
    <p>Now is the time to acknowledge those feelings.</p>
    <p>Essentially what you're going to do is recognise those feelings, which means accepting as a consequence of your own actions, and then you're going to let go of them.</p>
    <p>These feelings are counter-productive, and you've been carrying them around for far too long.</p>

    <p>So for now, we're going to say goodbye to them and move on.</p>
    <p>Acknowledge. Let go.</p>
