One important point that I would like to emphasise is that a lot of those things actually have nothing to do with porn addiction. 

For example,  you don’t necessarily require a porn addiction in order to be unmotivated. You can certain be unmotivated without a porn addiction. 

Which is also to say that a lot of the skills we will be developing have nothing to do with porn addiction at all. 

In a sense, pornography addiction has very little to do with pornography itself. 

While pornography itself is an addictive behaviour, much in the same way that alcohol, gambling and video games can be addictive, this doesn’t help explain why some of us find pornography to be so terribly destructive. 

To answer that question, we instead need to take a look at some of the beliefs that we may have developed throughout our lives, which may have influenced the way we feel about sex, women, pornography and most importantly, ourselves. 

In reality, porn addiction is a symptom of something greater. It is the result of misunderstanding on multiple levels. We are misunderstanding what women are. We are misunderstanding what happiness is. We are misunderstanding the value of time and in a lot cases, misunderstanding . 

Only by correctly these things can we 


Struggle sport

An important point I want to bring up, that I think is often misunderstood, is that if porn addiction is something that you consistently struggle with, then you’re most likely doing something wrong. 






I hope in reading this website that you discover a fundamental theme in all my posts: Overcoming porn addiction should be simple and effortless.

I didn’t up successfully give up pornography by fighting my emotions and cravings. It was only once I was able to detach myself from what I was feeling, that I was able to break through and commit to a life without porn.

Essentially, the moral of the story, is that If you’re really struggling with giving up porn, then there’s some aspect of your personality that you’re not yet familiar with. And it’s not until you fully understand who you are, that you can build up the confidence to commit to your goals. That’s what we’re here to discover.






While I’ve provided some context into what porn addiction is, let’s really get into the meat of things and discover some of the lessons I’ve personally had to learn in order to deal with my pornography addiction in a controlled and comfortable matter. 













Of course, it's also a change in mindset, from being a victim (where you believe the world is choosing for you) verse to becoming the creator (where you dictate how you move forward).

And when you realise that you can become anything you want, it changes the way you think about who and what you are.

With that said, what exactly can we choose?

- We can choose what we want to think, and whether we want to think at all. 
- We can choose what we want to believe, and whether we want to believe at all. 
- We can choose how we want to feel, and whether we want to feel at all.

As you can tell, the overwhelming theme is that we have control over our mind.

And when you realise that your mind consists of almost everything relating to your human existence, you realise that you actually are fully in control of who you are, irrespective of all the other choices that you may have had made for you.

The reason why I emphasise Choice over mind is because it's a principle which I can strongly relate to in my own life. 

I didn't really have it great growing up.

I didn't have a supportive family, let alone much of a family at all. 

I didn't really have a lot of friends, and I didn't really get to experience many of the things that a lot of people generally get to experience growing up. 

And sure, a lot of that was influenced by my own actions and mental health, but it simply was my human experience.

Which made me sad.

And yet when you realise that you don't have to 


Break ups are a perfect example. 






<!-- Instead of being obsessed with "I work out constantly and yet I don't have the genetics for a six pack" the narrative becomes something more along the lines of "I cannot believe how amazingly strong I've become."

Which is to say that the victim mindset is just a filter over what you see and perceive.  -->




No longer would she react and take my moods personally, thinking that it was because I had something against her. 


Not only does the guilt eat away at you, but without having someone to talk about it with, it's hard to ask for help when you need it most. 

In addition, I'd hit a point in my life where I could no longer cope, and in talking about it with someone, decided to take it seriously. 









Sure, you probably feel good that you can count the number of days since your last relapse on two hands. 

But what on earth does this actually have to do with porn recovery? How is comparing yourself to a past failure going to help you become a better person today?

On the otherhand, concerning yourself with what you personally did that day to improve your ability to focus, is wonderful.

The primary reason why it's wonderful is because it builds your awareness of the things you did right, which helps you make correct decisions in the future.

This is why it's important to journal your efforts and note down which practices you did that day, so you can acknowledge what you achieved and how it made you feel.

Remember.

Practice. Practice. Practice.








In order to understand this, we need to understand what actions are, and more importantly how we use them to create outcomes.








<!-- 
More often than not, the reason why we're struggling to gain traction with our porn recovery is because we're working against ourselves in some way.

Even if we're eating healthily, practicing meditation, exercising regularly etc. all it takes is one counter-productive action to derail all this hard work. 

In most cases, leaving us confused and wondering how we could have possibly gone wrong inspite of all the hard work we've put in.  -->
