- The key thing to understand about practice. It's not so much about whether you're aware of what you're learning, because often for the first few weeks, this can be oblivious to us. What it's truly about is committing our brain to the motions of practice, which provides physical changes which isn't oblivious in a real sense.

Simply by engaging in these positive activities, we change the brain.

The game here is to change the brain, one step at a time. Each step we make changes our brain. Gradually over time, it will all make sense. 

The question is, are you willing to commit? 

- Is porn fundamentally wrong? No, but that blah blah blah
- Should I orgasm on NeverFap?
- Why do I keep relapsing? (Are you meditating?)

Overcoming porn addiction is a doing, not a thinking 

No amount of thinking is going to help you. It is purely a process. That is why I put such a strong emphasis on the process and trusting it. Because those who overthinking don't know how to do.
